  Static
    LU preconditioner

  ParaView
    Python script to view displacement field
    Python script to view material properties (shear modulus)

  Exercise: Shear instead of axial compression

Step02: Coseismic [exercise]
  DirichletBC constraining normal displacement on lateral and bottom boundaries
  Prescribed uniform slip (UniformDB) on slab fault patch with viscoelastic relaxation
  Viscosity via CompositeDB (single SimpleGridDB with viscosity as a fn of depth)
  Quasistatic
    field split + custom preconditioner

  ParaView
    Python script to view prescribed slip
    Python script to view relaxation of shear stress

  Exercise: Change slip on slab to slip on splay fault
  Exercise: Slip on lower slab and splay fault
  Exercise: Slip on slab and splay fault

Step03: Interseismic [tutorial]
  DirichletBC with constant velocity (compression)
  Prescribed fault slip with constant slip rate (UniformDB) [lower slab]
  Prescribed fault slip with constant slip rate at depth (SimpleGridDB) [top slab]
  Quasistatic

Step04: Earthquake cycle [exercise]
  Interseismic + coseismic

Step05: Compression with frictional interface [tutorial]
  Interseismic + rate- and state-friction
  Quasistatic

Step06: Slow slip event [tutorial]

    Time history slip-time function
  Quasistatic
  OutputSolnPoints

Step07: Green's functions [tutorial]
  Generate Green's functions (slab patch + splay patch?)
  Simple inversion of GPS data (slip on slab or splay?)
  OutputSolnPoints

Step08: Gravity
  uniform density (SimpleDB), demonstrate initial stresses to compensate gravity
  variable density (match Step01), initial stress matches avg desnity, elastic: demonstrate deviation
  variable density, elastic+viscoelastic: demonstrate problems
