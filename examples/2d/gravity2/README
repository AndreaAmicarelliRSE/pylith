The suite of examples in this directory illustrate the use of
gravitational body forces and the small strain formulation.

The main features of this example are:
  * gravitational body forces in 2-D
  * small strain formulation (large rigid body motions and small strains)
  * viscoelastic relaxation with a linear Maxwell model
  * direct solver in simulations without a fault
  * iterative solver with custom preconditioner for a fault

Problem Setup

The geometry of the problem is a 200km-wide by 100km-deep domain with
a flat ground surface. We use a 30km-thick elastic layer over a linear
Maxwell viscoelastic half-space to approximate the crust and mantle. A
reverse fault dipping 45 degrees cuts through the elastic layer and
extends in the top portion of the viscoelastic layer. Gravitational
body forces act in the vertical direction. We apply roller Dirichlet
boundary conditions to constrain the displacement normal to the
boundary.

We discretize the domain using quadrilateral cells with a nominal cell
size of 2.0km. The general parameters are included in the
pylithapp.cfg file, which will be read by default.


Mesh generation (optional)

  NOTE: The result of this step will overwrite the included file
        mesh.exo. You may want to copy/rename this file so that
        you have a backup copy in case you have difficulty running
        CUBIT/Trelis.

  Start CUBIT and play the journal file "mesh.jou". We highly
  recommend that you study the contents of the journal files to
  understand the mesh generation process.


Step 1. Gravitational body forces and infinitesimal strain

  This simulation does not use initial stresses, so the gravitational
  body forces cause the domain to compress in the vertical
  direction. The shear stresses in the mantle relax, so that the
  solution trends towards sigma_xx == sigma_yy.

  Run the simulation via the following command:
    pylith gravity_infstrain.cfg


Step 2. Gravitational body forces and finite strain

  This simulation does not use initial stresses, so the gravitational
  body forces cause the domain to compress in the vertical
  direction. The shear stresses in the mantle relax, so that the
  solution trends towards sigma_xx == sigma_yy.

  Run the simulation via the following command:
    pylith gravity_finstrain.cfg


Step 3. Gravitational body forces, finite strain, and initial stresses

  This simulation uses depth-dependent initial stresses that satisfy
  the governing equations. As a result, there is zero
  deformation. This simulation uses a static simulation to demonstrate
  that no deformation results when the initial stresses satisfy the
  governing equations.

  Run the simulation via the following command:
    pylith gravity_isostatic.cfg


Step 4. Gravitational body forces, finite strain, initial stresses,
  and local density variation.

  This simulation adds a local density variation in the elastic layer
  to the problem considered in Step 3. Near the origin, the density is
  reduced in a semi-circular region, roughly approximating a
  sedimentary basin. In this region, the initial stresses do not
  satisfy the governing equation and the solution evolves to a steady
  state.

  Run the simulation via the following command:
    pylith gravity_vardensity.cfg


Step 5. Postseismic relaxation with infinitesimal strain.

  We impose slip on the reverse fault within the elastic layer and
  compute the postseismic deformation associated with relaxation in
  the mantle. The solution

  Run the simulation via the following command:
    pylith postseismic.cfg postseismic_infstrain.cfg


Step 6. Postseismic relaxation with finite strain.

  We impose slip on the reverse fault within the elastic layer and
  compute the postseismic deformation associated with relaxation in
  the mantle.

  Run the simulation via the following command:
    pylith postseismic.cfg postseismic_infstrain.cfg


Suggested variations

  The list below includes some suggested modifications to the suite of
  examples that will allow you to become more familiar with some of
  the subtle issues that arise when dealing with gravitational body
  forces and finite strain.

  * Change the cells from quadrilaterals to triangles. How does this
    affect the solution? Can you identify any differences in the
    numerical accuracy?

  * In Step 4, extend the earthquake slip into the viscoelastic layer?
    How does this affect the postseismic deformation?

  * In Step 3, add topography or increase the size/amplitude of the
    local density perturbation to the elastic layer. How does this
    solution differ from Step 4?
