\section{Overview}

PyLith is a multi-scale simulation software package for earthquake
physics. It is portable, scalable software for simulation of crustal
deformation across spatial scales ranging from meters to hundreds
of kilometers and temporal scales ranging from milliseconds to thousands
of years.

\section{History}

PyLith 1.0 was the first version to allow the solution of both implicit
(quasi-static) and explicit (dynamic) problems and was a complete
rewrite of the original PyLith (version 0.8). PyLith 1.0 combines
the functionality of EqSim \cite{Aagaard:etal:2001a,Aagaard:etal:2001b}
and PyLith 0.8. PyLith 0.8 was a direct descendant of LithoMop and
was the first version that ran in parallel, as well as providing several
other improvements over LithoMop. LithoMop was the product of major
reengineering of Tecton, a finite-element code for simulating static
and quasi-static crustal deformation. The major new features present
in LithoMop included dynamic memory allocation and the use of the
Pyre simulation framework and PETSc solvers. EqSim was written by
Brad Aagaard to solve problems in earthquake dynamics, including rupture
propagation and seismic wave propagation.

The release of PyLith 1.0 has been followed by additional releases
that expand the number of features as well as improve performance.
The PyLith 1.x series of releases allows the solution of both quasi-static
and dynamic problems in one, two, or three dimensions. The code runs
in either serial or parallel, and the design allows for relatively
easy scripting using the Python programming language. Material properties
and values for boundary and fault conditions are specified using spatial
databases, which permit easy prescription of complex spatial variations
of properties and parameters. Simulation parameters are generally
specified through the use of simple ASCII files or the command line.
At present, mesh information may be provided using a simple ASCII
file (PyLith mesh ASCII format) or imported from CUBIT or LaGriT,
two widely-used meshing packages. The elements currently available
include a linear bar in 1D, linear triangles and quadrilaterals in
2D, and linear tetrahedra and hexahedra in 3D. Materials presently
available include isotropic elastic, linear Maxwell viscoelastic,
generalized Maxwell viscoelastic, power-law viscoelastic, and Drucker-Prager
elastoplastic. Boundary conditions include Dirichlet (prescribed displacements
and velocities), Neumann (traction), point forces, and absorbing boundaries.
Cohesive elements are used to implement slip across interior surfaces
(faults) with both kinematically-specified fault slip and slip governed
by fault constitutive models. PyLith also includes an interface for
computing static Green's functions for fault slip.

PyLith 2.0 replaces the finite-element data structures provided by
the C++ Sieve implementation with those provided by the C DMPlex implementation.
The newly developed DMPlex implementation by the PETSc developers
conforms to the PETSc data manager (DM) interface, thereby providing
tighter integration with other PETSc data structures, such as vectors
and matrices. Other improvements include significantly reduced memory
use and memory balancing.

PyLith is under active development and we expect a number of additions
and improvements in the near future. Likely enhancements will include
additional bulk and fault constitutive models, coupled quasi-static
and dynamic simulations for earthquake cycle modeling, and coupling
between elasticity, heat flow, and/or fluid flow.


\section{PyLith Workflow}

PyLith is one component in the process of investigating problems in
tectonics (Figure \ref{fig:Workflow-summary}). Given a geological
problem of interest, a scientist must first provide a geometrical
representation of the desired structure. Once the structure has been
defined, a computational mesh must be created. PyLith presently provides
three mesh importing options: CUBIT Exodus format, LaGriT GMV and
Pset files, and PyLith mesh ASCII format. The modeling of the physical
processes of interest is performed by a code such as PyLith. Present
output consists of VTK or HDF5/Xdmf files which can be used by a number
of visualization codes (e.g., ParaView, Visit, and Matlab).

structure to problem analysis.}

\section{PyLith Design}

PyLith is separated into modules to encapsulate behavior and facilitate
use across multiple applications. This allows expert users to replace
functionality of a wide variety of components without recompiling
or polluting the main code. PyLith employs external packages (see
Figure \ref{fig:pylith-dependencies}) to reduce development time
and enhance computational efficiency; for example, PyLith 0.8 ran
two times faster when the PETSc linear solver was used.

\noindent \begin{center}
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering{}\includegraphics[width=4in]{intro/figs/packages}\caption{\label{fig:pylith-dependencies}PyLith dependencies. PyLith makes
direct use of several other packages, some of which have their own
dependencies.}
\end{figure}

\par\end{center}

PyLith is written in two programming languages. High-level code is
written in Python; this rich, expressive interpreted language with
dynamic typing reduces development time and permits flexible addition
of user-contributed modules. This high-level code makes use of Pyre,
a science-neutral simulation framework developed at Caltech, to link
the modules together at runtime and gather user-input. Low-level code
is written in C++, providing fast execution while still allowing an
object-oriented implementation. This low-level code relies on PETSc
to perform operations on matrices and vectors in parallel. We also
make extensive use of two Python packages. SWIG is a package that
simplifies the task of adding C++ extensions to Python code, and FIAT
provides tabulated basis functions and numerical quadrature points. 

In writing PyLith 1.0, the code was designed to be object-oriented
and modular. Each type of module is accessed through a specified interface
(set of functions). This permits adding, replacing, and rewriting
modules without affecting other parts of the code. This code structure
simplifies code maintenance and development. Extending the set of
code features is also easier, since developers can create new modules
derived from the existing ones.

The current code design leverages Pyre and PETSc extensively. Pyre
glues together the various modules used to construct a simulation
and specify the parameters. PETSc provides the finite-element data
structuresand handles the creation and manipulation of matrices and
vectors. As a result, most of the PyLith source code pertains to implementing
the geodynamics, such as bulk rheology, boundary conditions, and slip
on faults. 

PyLith also uses FIAT to tabulate the finite-element basis functions
at the numerical integration (quadrature) points. Nemesis allows PyLith
to run Python using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for parallel
processing. Additional, indirect dependencies (see Figure \ref{fig:pylith-dependencies})
include numpy (efficient operations on numerical arrays in Python),
Proj.4 (geographic projections), and SWIG (calling C++ functions from
Python).

During development, tests were constructed for nearly every module
function. These unit tests are distributed with the source code. These
tests are run throughout the development cycle to expose bugs and
isolate their origin. As additional changes are made to the code,
the tests are rerun to help prevent introduction of new bugs. A number
of simple, full-scale tests, such as axial compression and extension,
simple shear, and slip on through-going faults, have been used to
test the code. Additionally, we have run the Southern California Earthquake
Center crustal deformation and several of the spontaneous rupture
benchmarks for strike-slip and reverse-slip to determine the relative
local and global error (see Chapter \ref{cha:Benchmarks}).


\subsection{Pyre}

Pyre is an object-oriented environment capable of specifying and launching
numerical simulations on multiple platforms, including Beowulf-class
parallel computers and grid computing systems. Pyre allows the binding
of multiple components such as solid and fluid models used in Earth
science simulations, and different meshers. The Pyre framework enables
the elegant setup, modification and launching of massively parallel
solver applications.

is a set of cooperating abstract services.}
\end{figure}

\par\end{center}

Pyre is a framework, a combination of software and design philosophy
that promotes the reuse of code. In their canonical software design
book, \emph{Design Patterns}, Erich Gamma \textit{et al}. condense
the concept of a framework concept down to, ``When you use a framework,
you reuse the main body and write the code it calls.'' In the context
of frameworks and object-oriented programming, Pyre can be thought
of as a collection of classes and the way their instances interact.
Programming applications based on Pyre will look similar to those
written in any other object-oriented language. The Pyre framework
contains a subset of parts that make up the overall framework. Each
of those parts is designed to solve a specific problem.

The framework approach to computation offers many advantages. It permits
the exchange of codes and promotes the reuse of standardized software
while preserving efficiency. Frameworks are also an efficient way
to handle changes in computer architecture. They present programmers
and scientists with a unified and well-defined task and allow for
shared costs of the housekeeping aspects of software development.
They provide greater institutional continuity to model development
than piecemeal approaches.

The Pyre framework incorporates features aimed at enabling the scientific
non-expert to perform tasks easily without hindering the expert. Target
features for end users allow complete and intuitive simulation specification,
reasonable defaults, consistency checks of input, good diagnostics,
easy access to remote facilities, and status monitoring. Target features
for developers include easy access to user input, a shorter development
cycle, and good debugging support.


\subsection{PETSc}

PyLith 2.x makes use of a set of data structures and routines in PETSc
called \texttt{DMPlex}, which is still under active development. \texttt{DMPlex}
provides data structures and routines for for representing and manipulating
computational meshes, and it greatly simplifies finite-element computations.\texttt{ DMPlex}
represents the topology of the domain. Zero volume elements are inserted
along all fault surfaces to implement kinematic (prescribed) or dynamic
(constitutive model) implementations of fault slip. Material properties
and other parameters are represented as scalar and vector fields over
the mesh using vectors to store the values and sections to map vertices,
edges, faces, and cells to indices in the vector. For each problem,
functions are provided to calculate the residual and its Jacobian.
All numerical integration is done in these functions, and parallel
assembly is accomplished using the get/set closure paradigm of the
\texttt{DMPlex} framework. We assemble into PETSc linear algebra objects
and then call PETSc solvers.

PETSc \url{www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/petsc-as}, the Portable, Extensible
Toolkit for Scientific computation, provides a suite of routines for
parallel, numerical solution of partial differential equations for
linear and nonlinear systems with large, sparse systems of equations.
PETSc includes solvers that implement a variety of Newton and Krylov
subspace methods. It can also interface with many external packages,
including ESSL, MUMPS, Matlab, ParMETIS, PVODE, and Hypre, thereby
providing additional solvers and interaction with other software packages.

PETSc includes interfaces for FORTRAN 77/90, C, C++, and Python for
nearly all of the routines, and PETSc can be installed on most Unix
systems. PETSc can be built with user-supplied, highly optimized linear
algebra routines (e.g., ATLAS and commercial versions of BLAS/LAPACK),
thereby improving application performance. Users can use PETSc parallel
matrices, vectors, and other data structures for most parallel operations,
eliminating the need for explicit calls to Message Passing Interface
(MPI) routines. Many settings and options can be controlled with PETSc-specific
command-line arguments, including selection of preconditions, solvers,
and generation of performance logs.
