\section{Shear Wave in a Bar}

This suite of examples focuses on the dynamics of a shear wave propagating
down an 8 km-long bar with a 400 m-wide cross-section. Motion is limited
to shear deformation by fixing the longitudinal degree of freedom.
For each cell type (tri3, quad4, tet4, and hex8) we generate a shear
wave using a kinematic fault rupture with simultaneous slip over the
fault surface, which we place at the center of the bar. The discretization
size is 200 m in all cases. The slip-time histories follow the integral
of Brune's far-field time function with slip initiating at 0.1 s,
a left-lateral final slip of 1.0 m, and a rise time of 2.0 s. The
shear wave speed in the bar is 1.0 km/s, so the shear wave reaches
each end of the bar at 4.1 s. Absorbing boundaries on the ends of
the bar prevent significant vreflections. The bar comes to a rest with
a static offset.

of the bar while limiting deformation to the transverse direction.\label{fig:shearwave:domain}}

For the bar discretized with quad4 cells we also consider the fault
subjected to frictional sliding controlled by static friction, linear
slip-weakening friction, and rate- and state-friction. We use initial
tractions applied to the fault to drive the dislocation and generate
the shear wave. Because the fault tractions are constant in time,
they continue to drive the motion even after the shear wave reaches
the absorbing boundary, leading to a steady state solution with uniform
shear deformation in the bar and a constant slip rate on the fault.
