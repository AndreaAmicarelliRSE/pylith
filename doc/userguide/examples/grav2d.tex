\subsection{Overview}

This tutorial illustrates concepts related to using gravitational
body forces and finite (or small) strain. We focus on setting up initial
conditions consistent with gravitational body forces and using them
in a simulation of postseismic deformation with the small strain formulation.
We examine the differences between simulations with and without gravitational
body forces and the infinitesimal versus small strain formulation.

Steps 1-3 illustrate issues that arise when using gravitational body
forces and how to achieve realistic stress states. Steps 4-8 illustrate
the differences between infinitesimal and finite strain with and without
gravitational body forces for postseismic relaxation following an
earthquake with reverse slip.


\subsection{Problem Description}

The geometry of the problem is a 200km-wide by 100km-deep domain with
a flat ground surface. We use a 30km-thick elastic layer over a linear
Maxwell viscoelastic half-space to approximate the crust and mantle.
A reverse fault dipping 45 degrees cuts through the elastic layer
and extends into the top portion of the viscoelastic layer. Gravitational
body forces act in the vertical direction. We apply roller Dirichlet
boundary conditions to constrain the displacement normal to the boundary.

We discretize the domain using quadrilateral cells with a nominal
cell size of 2.0 km. We construct the mesh in CUBIT following the
same techniques used in the 2D subduction zone example, except that
this mesh is simpler. The main driver is in the journal file \texttt{mesh.jou}.
It calls the journal file \texttt{geometry.jou} to construct the geometry.
The mesh shown in Figure \vref{fig:examples:gravity:2d:mesh} The journal
files are documented and describe the various steps outlined below.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create the geometry defining the domain.
\item Set the meshing scheme and cell size.
\item Generate the mesh.
\item Create blocks for materials and nodesets for boundary conditions.
\item Export the mesh.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Additional Common Information}

As in the examples discussed in previous sections of these tutorials,
we place parameters common to all of the simulations in the \texttt{pylithapp.cfg}
file so that we do not have to duplicate them in each simulation parameter
file. In some cases we do override the values of parameters in simulation
specific parameter files. The settings contained in \texttt{pylithapp.cfg}
for this problem consist of:
\begin{description}
\item [{pylithapp.journal.info}] Settings that control the verbosity of
the output written to stdout for the different components.
\item [{pylithapp.mesh\_generator}] Settings that control mesh importing,
such as the importer type, the filename, and the spatial dimension
of the mesh.
\item [{pylithapp.problem}] Settings that control the problem, such as
the total time, time-step size, and spatial dimension. Note that we
turn off the elastic prestep here, since it is only used in the first
simulation. We also turn on gravity for the problem. The \texttt{total\_time}
of \texttt{2000.0{*}year }is used for most of the simulations.
\item [{pylithapp.problem.materials}] Settings that control the material
type, specify which material IDs are to be associated with a particular
material type, and give the name of the spatial database containing
the physical properties for the material. The quadrature information
is also given.
\item [{pylithapp.problem.bc}] We apply Dirichlet roller boundary conditions
(pin displacement perpendicular to the boundary) on the lateral sides
and bottom of the domain.
\item [{pylithapp.problem.formulation.output}] Settings related to output
of the solution over the domain and subdomain. We specify both displacements
and velocities for the output.
\item [{pylithapp.petsc}] PETSc settings to use for the problem, such as
the preconditioner type.
\end{description}
Since we do not desire an initial elastic solution prior to beginning
our time stepping for the simulations, we turn off the elastic prestep:
\begin{lyxcode}
{[}pylithapp.timedependent{]}

elastic\_prestep~=~False
\end{lyxcode}
For two-dimensional problems involving gravity, we also need to change
the default \texttt{gravity\_dir}:
\begin{lyxcode}
{[}pylithapp.timedependent{]}

gravity\_field~=~spatialdata.spatialdb.GravityField

gravity\_field.gravity\_dir~=~{[}0.0,~-1.0,~0.0{]}
\end{lyxcode}

\subsection{Step 1: Gravitational Body Forces and Infinitesimal Strain}

This simulation applies gravitational body forces to a domain without
any initial conditions, so the gravitational body forces cause the
domain to compress in the vertical direction. The shear stresses in
the mantle relax, so that the solution in the mantle trends towards
$\sigma_{xx}=\sigma_{yy}$. The crust is elastic and compressible,
so $\sigma_{xx}\neq\sigma_{\mathit{yy}}$. In the earth's crust we
generally observe $\sigma_{\mathit{xx}}\approx\sigma_{\mathit{yy}}$,
so this simulation does not yield a stress state consistent with that
observed in nature. The file \texttt{gravity\_infstrain.cfg} contains
the simulation specific parameter settings that augment those in \texttt{pylithapp.cfg}.
In addition to the filenames for the HDF5 ouput we also set the filename
for the progress monitor. You can look at this file during the simulation
to monitor the progress and get an estimate of when the simulation
will finish.

We run the simulation using:
\begin{lyxcode}
pylith~gravity\_infstrain.cfg
\end{lyxcode}
The simulation produces HDF5 (and corresponding XDMF) files with the
output of the displacements on the ground surface and the entire domain,
and the state variables for the crust and mantle. Note that the output
files contain both cauchy\_stress and stress fields. For problems
using the infinitesimal strain formulation, these are identical. For
the small strain formulation, the stress field corresponds to the
second Piola-Kirchoff stress tensor, which does not have the physical
meaning associated with the Cauchy stress. Loading the axial stress
fields for the crust and mantle into ParaView via the XDMF files (\texttt{output/gravity\_infstrain-crust.xmf}
and \texttt{output/gravity\_infstrain-mantle.xmf}) illustrates how
the axial stresses are not equal. We would like gravitational body
forces to yield nearly axial stresses consistent with the overburden
pressure observed in nature. 


\subsection{Step 2: Gravitational Body Forces, Infinitesimal Strain, and Initial
Stresses}

This simulation uses depth-dependent initial stresses that satisfy
the governing equations. As a result, there is zero deformation. In
practice, there would be no need to run such a simulation, because
the initial stresses give us the stress state produced in the simulation.
In Steps 3-7, we use these initial stresses as initial conditions
for postseismic deformation simulations. Because we reuse the initial
stress parameter settings in multiple simulations, we place them in
their own parameter file, \texttt{gravity\_initstress.cfg}. As in
Step 1, the simulation specific parameter file contains the filenames
for the output.

We run the simulation using:
\begin{lyxcode}
pylith~gravity\_initstress.cfg~gravity\_isostatic.cfg
\end{lyxcode}

\subsection{Step 3: Infinitesimal Strain Simulation with Initial Stresses and
a Local Density Variation}

This simulation adds a local density variation in the elastic layer
to the problem considered in Step 2. Near the origin, the density
is reduced in a semi-circular region with a radius of 5.0 km, roughly
approximating a sedimentary basin. In this example, we focus on the
workflow and use a coarse mesh so we are not concerned with the fact
that our mesh with a discretization size of 2.0 km does a poor job
of resolving this density variation; in a real research problem we
would use a finer mesh in the low density region. Figure \vref{fig:examples:gravity:2d:vardensity:density}shows
the spatial variation in density, including the contrast in density
between the mantle and crust and the circular low density region around
the origin.
\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[width=4in]{tutorials/grav2d/figs/gravity_vardensity-density}
\par\end{centering}

\caption{Spatial variation in density in the finite element mesh. The mantle
has a uniform density of 3400 kg/m$^{3}$ and the crust has a uniform
density of 2500 kg/m$^{3}$ except near the origin where we impose
a low density semi-circular region.\label{fig:examples:gravity:2d:vardensity:density}}
\end{figure}


We use the same initial stress state as for the previous two examples.
The initial stress state is a close approximation to the equilibrium
state, so there is little deformation. The mantle relaxes corresponding
to the viscous strains and shear stresses approaching zero; shear
stress associated with the lateral density variation becomes confined
to the crust. In the region with the lower density, the initial stresses
do not satisfy the governing equation and the solution slowly evolves
towards a steady state. This slow asymptotic evolution presents some
difficulties with using the output of this simulation (which has not
reached the equilibrium state) as a starting point in other simulations,
as we will see in Step 8. Nevertheless, this simulation serves as
an example of how to use initial stresses from vertically layered
material properties in computing an equilibrium or steady state stress
state associated with gravitational body forces and lateral density
variations or topography.

We run the simulation using:
\begin{lyxcode}
pylith~gravity\_initstress.cfg~gravity\_vardensity.cfg
\end{lyxcode}
Figure \vref{fig:examples:gravity:2d:vardensity:stress} shows the
shear stress field at the end of the simulation.

\caption{Shear stress in the crust (linearly elastic) and mantle (linear Maxwell
viscoelastic) associated gravitational body forces and a low density
region forces.\label{fig:examples:gravity:2d:vardensity:stress}}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Step 4: Postseismic Relaxation with Infinitesimal Strain}

We impose slip on the reverse fault within the elastic layer and compute
the postseismic deformation associated with relaxation in the mantle.
We do not include gravitational body forces. The earthquake slip is
2.0 m above a depth of 15 km and tapers linearly to zero at a depth
of 20 km. We impose the earthquake at time 0.0 years, but use a start
time of -100 years so that any pre-earthquake deformation trends are
clear. We use one parameter file (\texttt{nogravity.cfg}) to turn
off gravity (by setting the gravitional acceleration to zero) and
another parameter file (\texttt{postseismic.cfg}) for the earthquake
related parameters. Note that we change the preconditioner to the
algebraic multigrid preconditioner for the elastic block and the custom
fault preconditioner for the Lagrange multipliers. 

We run the simulation using:
\begin{lyxcode}
pylith~postseismic.cfg~nogravity.cfg~postseismic\_infstrain\_nograv.cfg
\end{lyxcode}
Figure \vref{fig:examples:gravity:2d:postseismc:infstrain:disp} shows
the vertical displacement field at the end of the simulation.

\par\end{centering}

\caption{Vertical displacement at the end of the postseismic deformation simulation
(t=4000 years).\label{fig:examples:gravity:2d:postseismc:infstrain:disp}}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Step 5: Postseismic Relaxation with Finite Strain}

This simulation is the same as Step 4, but we use the finite strain
formulation.:
\begin{lyxcode}
{[}pylithapp.timedependent{]}

formulation~=~pylith.problems.ImplicitLgDeform
\end{lyxcode}
When we use the finite strain formulation, the solver is automatically
switched to the nonlinear solver. We run the simulation using:
\begin{lyxcode}
pylith~postseismic.cfg~nogravity.cfg~postseismic\_finstrain\_nograv.cfg
\end{lyxcode}
The results are nearly identical to those with infinitesimal strain.


\subsection{Step 6: Postseismic Relaxation with Infinitesimal Strain and Gravitational
Body Forces}

This simulation is the same as Step 4, but we include gravitational
body forces. We use initial stresses that satisfy the governing equations,
so our initial conditions are axial stresses equal to the overburden
pressure. 

We run the simulation using:
\begin{lyxcode}
pylith~postseismic.cfg~postseismic\_infstrain.cfg
\end{lyxcode}
With the infinitesimal strain formulation and linearly material behavior,
the initial stress state of equal axial stresses does not alter the
response. We obtain a displacement field and shear stresses identical
to that in Step 4. The axial stresses are the superposition of the
initial stresses and those from the postseismic deformation.


\subsection{Step 7: Postseismic Relaxation with Finite Strain and Gravitational
Body Forces}

This simulation is the same as Step 5, but we include gravitational
body forces; this is also the same as Step 6, but with finite strain.

We run the simulation using:
\begin{lyxcode}
pylith~postseismic.cfg~postseismic\_finstrain.cfg
\end{lyxcode}
The finite strain formulation accounts for the redistribution of gravitational
body forces as the domain deforms during the postseismic response.
As a result, the displacement field differs from that in Steps 4-6.
To see this difference, we have created a ParaView state file to view
the ground surface deformation from the output of Steps 4-7. After
running all four simulations, open ParaView and load the state file
\texttt{postseismic.pvsm}. If you start ParaView from the \texttt{examples/2d/gravity}
directory (\texttt{PATH\_TO\_PARAVIEW/bin/paraview}, \texttt{File$\rightarrow$Load
State$\rightarrow$postseismic.pvsm}), you should not need to update
the locations of the filenames. If you start ParaView from a dock
or other directory, you will need to set the relative or absolute
paths to the output files. Figure \vref{fig:examples:gravity:2d:postseismic:groundsurf}
shows the ground deformation 2550 years after the earthquake using
the state file.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Displacement field on the ground surface after 2550 years of postseismic
deformation in Step 4 (Infinitesimal strain without gravity), Step
5 (Finite strain without gravity), Step 6 (Infinitesimal strain with
gravity), and 7 (Finite strain with gravity). The displacement fields
for Steps 4-6 are essentially identical. \label{fig:examples:gravity:2d:postseismic:groundsurf}}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Step 8: Postseismic Relaxation with Finite Strain, Gravitational
Body Forces, and Variable Density}

We use the output of Step 3 to create realistic initial stresses for
this simulation of postseismic deformation with variable density.
In Step 3 we average the stresses over the quadrature points within
a cell using CellFilterAvg. For initial stresses consistent with the
state of the simulation at the end of Step 3, we want the stresses
at each of the quadrature points. Note that Step 3 uses the infintesimal
strain formulation and for Step 8 we will use a finite strain formulation;
any inconsistencies in using the output from a simulation with one
strain formulation as the input in a simulation for another strain
formulation are very small given that we start Step 8 from an undeformed
state so that the Cauchy stresses are very close to the second Pioloa-Kirchoff
stresses. Our first step is to modify the \texttt{pylithapp.cfg} file
by commenting out the lines with the CellFilterAvg settings:
\begin{lyxcode}
\#~Comment~this~out~for~if~rerunning~Step~3~to~get~initial~conditions~for~Step~8.

\#cell\_filter~=~pylith.meshio.CellFilterAvg
\end{lyxcode}
for both the crust and mantle. Next we rerun Step 3 using
\begin{lyxcode}
pylith~gravity\_initstress.cfg~gravity\_vardensity.cfg
\end{lyxcode}
This will change how the values appear in ParaView output. Because
the output data fields contain the values at multiple points within
a cell, PyLith does not label them as tensor components; instead,
it simply numbers the values 0..N. For the stress tensor components,
values 0, 1, and 2 are the $\sigma_{\mathit{xx}}$, $\sigma_{\mathit{yy}}$,
and $\sigma_{\mathit{xy}}$ values at the first quadrature point;
values 3, 4, and 5 correspond to the values at the second quadrature
point, etc. We use the Python script \texttt{generate\_statedb.py}
to generate the spatial databases with the initial stresses from the
output of Step 3:
\begin{lyxcode}
./generate\_statedb.py
\end{lyxcode}
After generating the initial state variables, we uncomment the \texttt{cell\_filter}
lines in \texttt{pylithapp.cfg} to allow easier visualization of Step
8 results. Finally, we run the simulation of the postseismic deformation
using
\begin{lyxcode}
pylith~postseismic.cfg~gravity\_initstress.cfg~postseismic\_vardensity.cfg
\end{lyxcode}
In the 100 years before the earthquake, it is clear that there is
some ongoing deformation associated with the relaxation of the mantle.
Immediately following the earthquake the postseismic deformation signal
is stronger at most locations, but as it decays the ongoing deformation
associated with the gravitational body forces and variable density
become evident again. This ongoing deformation is most obvious in
the displacement and velocity fields. The postseismic deformation
is much more dominant for the stress field. This contamination by
the initial conditions can be avoided with initial stress conditions
at equilibrium as we did in Step 7. However, this is much more difficult
to obtain for complex lateral variations in density or topography.
Figure \vref{fig:examples:gravity:2d:postseismic:vardensity:shearstress}
shows the ground deformation at time 2000 years into the simulation
using the state file.

$\pm$1 MPa to show the evidence of viscoelastic relaxation (near
