\subsection{Overview}

This tutorial is meant to demonstrate most of the important features
of PyLith as a quasi-static finite-element code, using a sequence
of example problems. All problems use the same 3D hexahedral mesh
generated using the CUBIT \url{cubit.sandia.gov} mesh generation
package. Each example builds on the previous examples, as we demonstrate
new features. As in the other examples, the files include extensive
comments. We start with the generation of the mesh, which is composed
of 144 trilinear hexahedra. The tutorial demonstrates the usage of
the CUBIT mesh generation package to create a mesh, as well as describing
how to use a CUBIT-generated mesh in PyLith. Following the discussion
of how to generate the mesh, we discuss the \texttt{pylithapp.cfg}
file, which contains information common to all the simulations. We
group the examples into four sections, each pertaining to a particular
set of PyLith features. We suggest users go through each of these
sections in order as the complexity increases at each step. 


\subsection{Mesh Generation and Description}

The mesh for these examples is a simple rectangular solid (Figure
\vref{fig:3dhex8-mesh}). Although it would be possible to generate
this mesh by hand, it is much simpler to use a mesh generation package,
and we use CUBIT for this example. We provide documented journal files
in \texttt{examples/3d/hex8/mesh.} Dissection of these journal files
should provide some insight into how to use CUBIT with PyLith. For
more detailed information on using CUBIT, vrefer to the CUBIT documentation
\url{cubit.sandia.gov}. If you have CUBIT installed on your machine,
you can use the journal files to create your own mesh. Otherwise,
you can use the mesh that has already been created.

If you are using CUBIT to generate your own mesh, there are two ways
to use the journal files. The simplest method is to go to the\textsf{
Tools} menu, select \textsf{Play Journal File}, and then select the
file \texttt{mesh\_hex8\_1000m.jou}. This will run the commands in
that file as well as the commands in \texttt{geometry.jou}, which
is vreferenced from \texttt{mesh\_hex8\_1000m.jou}. Prior to doing
this, you should set your directory to the one containing the journal
files. This method will create the mesh, but you will gain very little
insight into what is being done. A more informative approach is to
input each journal command into the CUBIT command window directly.
That way, you will see what each command does. The first command in
\texttt{mesh\_hex8\_1000m.jou} is \texttt{`playback} \texttt{geometry.jou}',
so you should start with the commands in \texttt{geometry.jou}. The
first three commands, which define the block shape, are
\begin{lyxcode}
reset

brick~x~6000~y~6000~z~4000

volume~1~move~x~0~y~0~z~-2000
\end{lyxcode}
Continuing through the remainder of the commands in \texttt{geometry.jou},
and then using the additional commands in \texttt{mesh\_hex8\_1000m.jou},
you will eventually end up with the file \texttt{box\_hex8\_1000m.exo},
which contains all of the mesh information. This information is similar
to that included in PyLith mesh ASCII format, but the information
is contained in an Exodus file, which is a specialized netCDF file.
If you have the \texttt{ncdump} command available, you can see what
is in the file by typing:
\begin{lyxcode}
ncdump~box\_hex8\_1000m.exo
\end{lyxcode}
\noindent \begin{center}

\subsection{Additional Common Information}

In addition to the mesh, the example problems share other information.
As in previous examples, we place this information in \texttt{pylithapp.cfg}.
Since these examples use a mesh from CUBIT, in this file we set the
importer to \texttt{MeshIOCubit}:
\begin{lyxcode}
{[}pylithapp.mesh\_generator{]}

reader~=~pylith.meshio.MeshIOCubit~\\
~\\


{[}pylithapp.mesh\_generator.reader{]}

filename~=~mesh/box\_hex8\_1000m.exo
\end{lyxcode}
This example differs from some earlier examples, because we specify
two material groups:
\begin{lyxcode}
{[}pylithapp.timedependent{]}

materials~=~{[}upper\_crust,lower\_crust{]}~\\
~\\


{[}pylithapp.timedependent.materials.upper\_crust{]}

label~=~Upper~crust~material

id~=~1

db.iohandler.filename~=~spatialdb/mat\_elastic.spatialdb

quadrature.cell~=~pylith.feassemble.FIATLagrange

quadrature.cell.dimension~=~3~\\
~\\


{[}pylithapp.timedependent.materials.lower\_crust{]}

label~=~Lower~crust~material

id~=~2

db.iohandler.filename~=~spatialdb/mat\_elastic.spatialdb

quadrature.cell~=~pylith.feassemble.FIATLagrange

quadrature.cell.dimension~=~3
\end{lyxcode}
The two material groups correspond to the two different colored regions
in Figure \vref{fig:3dhex8-mesh}. Using two material groups allows
us to specify different material types or material variations for
the upper crust and lower crust, if desired. For now, we retain the
default \texttt{ElasticIsotropic3D} material type for both materials.
This behavior will be overridden by example-specific\texttt{.cfg}
files in some of the examples. Although the material groups are specified
in \texttt{pylithapp.cfg}, the physical properties for the material
models are given in \texttt{spatialdb/}~\linebreak{}
\texttt{mat\_elastic.spatialdb}. This spatial database provides values
at a single point, resulting in uniform properties within the material.


\subsection{Example Problems}

The example problems are divided into categories that roughly correspond
to simple static problems, quasi-static problems, problems involving
fault friction, and problems where gravity is used. For the most part,
each successive example involves just adding or changing a few parameters
from the previous example. For this reason, it is advisable to go
through each example in order, starting with the simplest (static
problems).
