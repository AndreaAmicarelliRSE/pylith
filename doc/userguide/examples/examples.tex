\chapter{Examples}
\label{cha:examples}

\section{Overview}

Each example is a self-contained lesson in how to use PyLith. The
examples increase in degree of complexity from one to the next.


\subsection{Prerequisites}

Before you begin any of the examples, you will need to install PyLith
following the instructions in Chapter~\vref{cha:installation}.  For
more complex examples, you will also need either CUBIT
\url{cubit.sandia.gov} or LaGriT \url{meshing.lanl.gov} mesh
generation software to create the meshes. If you do not wish to create
your own mesh at this time, the meshes are also provided as part of
the example. The ParaView \url{www.paraview.org} visualization
package may be used to view simulation results. ParaView 3 includes
built-in documentation that is accessed by clicking on the Help menu
item. Some additional documentation is available on the ParaView Wiki
site \url{paraview.org/Wiki/ParaView}.  You may use other
visualization software, but some adaption from what is described here
will be necessary. Furthermore, you can complete a subset of the
example using files provided (as described below), skipping the steps
for which you do not have the proper software packages installed.


\subsubsection{Input Files}

The files needed to work through the examples are found in the
\filename{examples} directory under the top-level PyLith
directory. There are five examples in \filename{examples/twocells},
each consisting of just two cells (elements).  These very simple
examples make use of PyLith mesh ASCII format to define the mesh. This
format is useful for understanding the basics of how PyLith works,
since it is easy to create these files by hand.  More complex
problems, such as those found in \filename{examples/3d}, use external
mesh generation software to create the meshes. All of the files used
in the example problems are extensively documented with comments.

\section{Additional Examples}


\subsection{CUBIT Meshing Examples}

The directory \filename{examples/meshing} contains several examples
of using CUBIT to construct finite-element meshes for complex geometry.
This includes features such as constructing nonplanar fault geometry
from contours, constructing topography from a DEM, and merging sheet
bodies (surfaces). A separate examples discusses defining the discretization
size using a vertex field in an Exodus-II file. See the \filename{README}
files in the subdirectories for more detailed descriptions of these
examples.


\subsection{Debugging Examples}
\label{sub:debugging:examples}

The directory \filename{examples/debugging} contains a few examples to
practice debugging a variety of user errors in parameters files and
problem setup. The files with the errors corrected are in
\filename{examples/debugging/correct}.  Step-by-step corrections are
discussed in the Debugging PyLith Simulations sessions of the 2014 and
2015 PyLith tutorials
(\url{wiki.geodynamics.org/software:pylith:start}).


\subsection{Code Verification Benchmarks}

The CIG GitHub software repository \url{https://github.com/geodynamics/pylith_benchmarks}
contains input files for a number of community benchmarks. The benchmarks
do not include the mesh files because they are so large; instead they
include the CUBIT journal files that can be used to generate the meshes.
Most, but not all, of the input files in the repository are updated
for PyLith v2.0.0, so you will need to modify them if you use another
version of PyLith.
