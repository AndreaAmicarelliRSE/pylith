Greetings,

I am pleased to announce the release of PyLith 2.1.0, a finite-element
code designed to solve dynamic elastic problems and quasi-static
viscoelastic problems in tectonic deformation.

This release provides several a few new small features and bugfixes.

You can download the source code and binaries from

    http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/pylith

Detailed installation instructions for the binary packages are in the
User Manual with detailed building instructions for a few platforms in
the INSTALL file bundled with the PyLith Installer utility.


======================================================================
MIGRATING FROM VERSION 2.0 TO 2.1
======================================================================

The partitioner setting has been integrated into PETSc. As a result,
the partitioner is set via PETSc settings, not a Distributor
property. For example,

[pylithapp.petsc]
petscpartitioner_type = chaco ; Available options ['chaco','parmetis']

The points file for OutputSolnPoints must now contain station names as
the first column.

======================================================================
RELEASE NOTES
======================================================================

* Station names are required for output at arbitrary points
  (OutputSolnPoints) and are included in a /stations dataset in HDF5
  files.

* A progress monitor will update a text file with the progress of a
  simulation (time in the time stepping loop or the number of impulses
  completed) and given an estimate of when the simulation will be
  completed.

* The partitioner is now set via a PETSc parameter, petscpartitioner_type.

* Bug fixes

  - A few bugs related to creating cohesive cells for fault
    intersections have been fixed. Faults can now meet at T
    intersections provided the buried edges of the faults are
    clamped. In other words, the fault ending at the T intersection
    has a clamped edge along the intersection. The fault ending at the
    intersection must also come AFTER the through-going fault in the
    list of fault interfaces.
