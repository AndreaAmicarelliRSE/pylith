How to safely handle Python/C++ inheritance.

SWIG interface files class declarations should match C++.

Python object inheritance should match C++.
Python objects should also inherit from corresponding SWIG interface object.
Only call the SWIG interface constructor ONCE.
  Call _createModuleObj() in __init__ from highest level parent with a SWIG interface.
  Implement _createModuleObj() in non-abstract derived classes.
  Avoid duplicate calls:
    if not hasattr(self, "this"):
        MODULE.__init__(self)

Python objects should have derived object type plus corresponding proxy to SWIG interface object.
