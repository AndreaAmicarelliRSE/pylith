Naming conventions:

Residual functions:

  pylith_fekernels_{EQUATION}_{KERNEL}

Jacobians functions:

  pylith_fekernels_{EQUATION}_{KERNEL}_{IJ}_{IMPLICIT/EXPLICIT}

where:

{EQUATION} is the name of the equation, such as DispVel, Elasticity, IsotropicLinearElasticityPlaneStrain

{KERNEL} is the name of the kernel, such as f0, f1, g0, g1, Jf0, Jf1, Jf2, Jf3, Jg0, Jg1, Jg2, Jg3

{IJ} identifies the fields associated with the Jacobian submatrix, such as uu, uv, vu, vv.

{IMPLICIT/EXPLICIT} is used to identify LHS Jacobians for the implicit and explicit case, such as implicit and explicit.

Additional suffixes, such as "_initstate", should be appended to the
function names to designate specific cases, such as the presence of
additional auxiliary fields for initial stress and initial strain.

Examples of equations:
pylith_fekernels_IsotropicLinearElasticityPlaneStrain
pylith_fekernels_IsotropicLinearIncompElasticityPlaneStrain
