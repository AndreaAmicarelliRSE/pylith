Naming conventions:

Everything starts with pylith_fekernels
Next is equation, e.g., DispVel, IsotropicLinearElasticityPlaneStrain, etc.
Next is kernel, e.g., f0, f1, g0, g1, Jf0, etc.
Next is specificity, e.g., what is the kernel coupling (e.g., uv), or
different cases (e.g., initstate).
Finally, if kernel is specific for implicit or explicit, put that.
